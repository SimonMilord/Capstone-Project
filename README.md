# Stonkers Stock Tracking App

Stonkers is a fully responsive web app that allows the user, once logged in to their account, to look up quotes, charts, news and stats of stocks. It also allows the user to add their favorite stocks to a watchlist for them to keep track of.

## The Problem

The stock market and the world of investments is one that is gatekept by unnecessary noise and complexity by traditional incumbents. Many are afraid to take control over their financial situation because it all seems too complex  and time consuming to learn and manage. Stonkers seek to provide beginners and new investor a simple to use interface to help them keep an eye on their investments.
